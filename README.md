A personal project for showcasing MVVM, Jetpack Compose, Test Driven Development, Dagger, benchmarking and more. The main focus is to show adherance to Uncle Bob's clean architecture and the MVx architecture backed by Vasiliy Zukanov as "the most battle-tested architectural pattern for Androifd development".

Functionaly, the app simply fetches new questions from StackOverflow's website and allows the user to view answers to the questions.
